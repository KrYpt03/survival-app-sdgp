## Admin Interface

- [x] Created admin API routes with validation
- [x] Added metrics reporting endpoints
- [x] Implemented cache management endpoints
- [x] Added system health monitoring endpoints
- [x] Fixed TypeScript errors in middleware application

## Known Issues and TODOs

- [ ] Implement full test coverage for new middleware
- [ ] Complete integration tests for admin API routes
- [x] Connect performance monitoring middleware in Express application
- [ ] Connect rate limiters to Redis for distributed deployments
- [ ] Add observability tools (Prometheus metrics, etc.)
- [ ] Set up alerting for system health issues

## Notes for Future Development

1. The admin API is currently using a simplified rate limiter implementation. In production, replace it with the proper Redis-backed rate limiter.

2. The database indexes have been created, but they should be monitored for performance and adjusted as needed based on query patterns.

3. The caching middleware is using in-memory cache. For production with multiple instances, implement a distributed cache like Redis.

4. Security headers and CORS configuration should be reviewed and updated based on the specific production environment requirements.

5. The error handling middleware captures most common cases, but may need to be extended based on application-specific requirements.

6. The monitoring infrastructure uses an in-memory NodeCache, which should be replaced with a more robust solution like Prometheus for production environments.
